# E-Commerce React + Redux + GraphQL + Tailwind


### Using Graphql API in development mode

1. Create an .env file and set an environment variable pointing to your local development server. Example given:
   
`VITE_GRAPHQL_API=http://localhost:3000/graphql`

It is important that the environment variable starts with `VITE_` as this is the required prefix for VITE to load and read environment variables.
